**Situation**

The company faced challenges with a new product's marketing campaign, which exhibited low success rates and inefficient customer targeting, complicating strategic decision-making.

**Task**

I was tasked with conducting an exploratory data analysis to uncover underlying patterns and inefficiencies in the campaign data, aiming to provide actionable insights for improving future marketing efforts.

**Action**

Utilizing Python, I performed detailed data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the dataset for analysis. I then employed various statistical techniques and data visualization tools, such as Seaborn and Matplotlib, to analyze campaign performance across different demographics and time periods. Key aspects such as contact methods, customer age groups, and monthly campaign activity were scrutinized.

**Result**

The analysis revealed critical insights: campaigns in May and November had high contact but low success rates, indicating possible customer fatigue. The most responsive age groups were identified as below 30 and above 60, suggesting a need for targeted marketing strategies. My findings led to recommendations for optimized campaign scheduling and refined demographic targeting, which the marketing team plans to implement in the next campaign cycle to enhance effectiveness and customer engagement.
